## Features
- **Task automation**: The agent can perform tasks and commands based on user goals.
- **API**: The agent can be accessed via the API.
- **Multiple AI engine support**: OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google Gemini, Ollama (local and cloud), OpenRouter (unified API for multiple models).
- **Local and remote execution (SSH)**: Run commands on your machine or remote hosts.
- **Configurable via `.env`**: Easily switch engines and settings.
- **Logging and colored console (Rich)**: Fallout/Pip-Boy theme for a unique retro look.
- **Chat mode**: Talk to Vault 3000 in the console, with conversation memory.
- **Advanced Prompt Creator**: Interactive tool for building precise, detailed prompts for AI agents. Guides you step-by-step, asks clarifying questions, and combines your answers into a single, actionable prompt. Supports multiline input (Ctrl+S), Fallout-style colors, and easy confirmation with Enter.
- **Two Operating Modes**: Work with the agent in **Collaborative Mode** (interactive confirmation for each command) or **Fully Automatic Mode** (agent executes commands autonomously). Switch dynamically during a session with Ctrl+A or configure via `.env` file.
- **Interactive Action Plan Management**: Before execution, the agent generates a step-by-step plan. In Collaborative Mode you can accept, reject, or edit the plan. The AI revises the plan based on your feedback.
- **Rich File Operations**: Agent has built-in tools to read, write, edit, copy, delete files and list directories — all with user confirmation in Collaborative Mode.
- **Web Search Agent**: Agent can search the internet during task execution using DuckDuckGo (no API key required) or a self-hosted SearxNG instance. Supports multi-source aggregation and content extraction.
- **Deep Analysis Sub-Agent**: After task completion, an optional sub-agent performs a comprehensive analysis of all session data (commands, outputs, file operations, web searches, plan steps) and generates a structured final report.
- **Critic Sub-Agent**: When the agent reports success, a critic sub-agent scores how correct the final answer is (0–10) relative to the original prompt.
- **Thread Continuation**: After finishing a task, you can continue the session with a new goal while preserving the full conversation history.
- **Enhanced JSON Validator**: Robust JSON parsing with up to 3 automatic correction attempts when the AI returns malformed responses.
- **Configurable Step Limit**: Built-in safeguard (`MAX_STEPS=100` by default) prevents infinite loops during task execution.

## Operating Modes

The agent supports two distinct modes of operation, allowing you to choose the level of control that best fits your workflow:

### Collaborative Mode (Interactive)
In this mode, the agent works as your collaborative partner. Before executing any bash command, file operation, or web search, the agent presents it to you and asks for confirmation. You can approve (`y`) or reject (`N`) each action individually, giving you full oversight of all actions performed on your system.

**When to use:**
- Learning new commands and their effects
- Working on production systems where caution is required
- Tasks where you want to understand each step before execution
- First-time automation of sensitive operations

**How to enable:**
- Set `AUTO_ACCEPT=false` in your `.env` file (default)
- Or press the mode switch shortcut during a session

### Fully Automatic Mode
In this mode, the agent operates autonomously, executing suggested commands without prompting for confirmation. The agent proceeds with the task workflow independently, only stopping to report results or ask clarifying questions when necessary.

**When to use:**
- Routine, well-understood automation tasks
- Development or testing environments
- Time-sensitive operations where speed is critical
- Tasks you've already verified and trust the agent to handle

**How to enable:**
- Set `AUTO_ACCEPT=true` in your `.env` file to start in automatic mode
- Or press `Ctrl+A` during an interactive session to switch to automatic mode on-the-fly

**Note:** The `Ctrl+A` shortcut is one-way - it switches from interactive to automatic mode during the current session. To return to collaborative mode, restart the agent with `AUTO_ACCEPT=false`.

## Agent Pipeline Modes

The agent supports three pipeline modes that control how the AI processes tasks and manages context:

### Compact Mode (`--compact`)
- Uses a simplified pipeline with a maximum of 3 LLM calls
- Compact prompts and streamlined state machine for faster decisions
- Minimal context overhead - ideal for simple, straightforward tasks
- Best for: Quick commands, simple file operations, routine automation

### Normal Mode (`--normal`)
- Full pipeline with complete conversation history and sliding window context
- All tools and features available with detailed step-by-step execution
- Maximum reliability and comprehensive task handling
- Best for: Complex tasks, multi-step workflows, critical operations

### Hybrid Mode (`--hybrid`, default)
- Starts with Compact Mode for efficiency
- Automatically falls back to Normal Mode if Compact fails or gets blocked
- Best of both worlds: speed when possible, reliability when needed
- Best for: General use, unknown task complexity, balanced performance

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Compact | Normal | Hybrid |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| LLM Calls | Max 3 | Unlimited | Starts at 3, fallback if needed |
| Context Size | Minimal | Full | Adaptive |
| Speed | Fast | Slower | Balanced |
| Reliability | Basic | High | High |
| Best For | Simple tasks | Complex tasks | General use |

### How to Choose

- **Use Compact** when you know the task is simple and want quick results
- **Use Normal** when reliability is critical or tasks are complex
- **Use Hybrid** (default) for the best balance in most scenarios

## AI Model Comparison

Before configuring your AI engine, check out the comprehensive comparison of AI models at [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models). This independent analysis covers intelligence benchmarks, performance metrics, and pricing across 337+ models from major providers including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and others. It's an invaluable resource for choosing the right AI model for your specific needs and budget.

## Terminal Agent Capabilities

The main terminal agent is a powerful tool designed to streamline your command-line operations. It allows you to perform a wide range of tasks, including:
- **Linux Administration**: Manage your system with ease.
- **Security**: Implement and maintain security measures.
- **Log Analysis**: Monitor and analyze system logs effectively.
- **Script Creation**: Develop custom scripts for automation.
- **Configuration Files**: Manage configuration files, such as those for Ansible.
- **Software Development**: Build and deploy applications.
- **Internet Research**: Search the web for information needed to complete tasks.

## Agent Tools

The agent communicates via JSON tool calls. Each tool is available to the AI during task execution:

### Execution Tools
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bash` | Execute shell commands locally or via SSH. Supports custom timeout. |
| `web_search_agent` | Search the internet using DuckDuckGo or SearxNG. |

### File Operation Tools
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_file` | Read file content, optionally specifying start/end line numbers. |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file with specified content. |
| `edit_file` | Edit a file: `replace`, `insert_after`, `insert_before`, or `delete_line`. |
| `list_directory` | List directory contents, optionally recursive with glob pattern. |
| `copy_file` | Copy a file to a new location (with optional overwrite). |
| `delete_file` | Delete a file (with optional backup). |

### Plan & Communication Tools
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `update_plan_step` | Mark a plan step as `completed`, `failed`, `skipped`, or `in_progress`. |
| `ask_user` | Ask the user a question (only available in Collaborative Mode). |

### Completion Tool
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `finish` | Signal task completion with a detailed summary. On success, triggers the Critic Sub-Agent; also offers the optional Deep Analysis Sub-Agent. |

All file and search operations in **Collaborative Mode** ask for user confirmation (`[y/N]`) before proceeding. If refused, the user is prompted for a justification that is fed back to the AI.

## Action Plan Management

Before starting task execution, the agent automatically generates a step-by-step action plan based on your goal.

### How it works:
1. **Plan Generation**: The AI creates a structured plan with numbered steps, each with a description and optional command.
2. **Plan Review** (Collaborative Mode only): The plan is displayed and you are asked:
   - `y` — Accept the plan and start execution
   - `n` / `e` — Reject or edit: describe your changes, the AI revises the plan accordingly
3. **Plan Execution**: The agent executes steps in order, marking each as `completed`, `failed`, or `skipped` using the `update_plan_step` tool.
4. **Finish Guard**: The agent cannot call `finish` until all plan steps are completed (or marked as failed/skipped). If it tries, it is reminded to complete the remaining steps first.
5. **Progress Display**: After each action, a compact plan progress summary is shown.

### Example plan display:
```
 ACTION PLAN
 Step 1: [✓] Analyze goal and requirements
 Step 2: [✓] Install required packages
 Step 3: [⟳] Configure the service
 Step 4: [ ] Verify the installation
 Progress: 2/4 (50%)
```

## Deep Analysis Sub-Agent

After the agent finishes a task, you are offered an optional **Deep Analysis Sub-Agent** that performs a comprehensive post-task report.

```
VaultAI> Run Deep Analysis Sub-Agent for a detailed session report? [y/N]:
```

### What it analyzes:
- ✅ Full conversation history (user, agent, system messages)
- ✅ All executed bash commands and their outputs
- ✅ File operations performed (read, write, edit, copy, delete)
- ✅ Web search results gathered during the session
- ✅ Action plan steps with statuses and results
- ✅ Agent's own finish summary

### Report structure:
| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Goal Achievement Assessment** | Was the goal achieved? Success rating (1–10). |
| **Execution Summary** | Total steps, key actions, critical decisions. |
| **What Worked Well** | Successful operations with specific details. |
| **Problems & Failures** | Failed commands, root cause analysis, workarounds. |
| **Deep Technical Analysis** | Key outputs, system state changes, security notes. |
| **Recommendations** | Next steps, potential risks, improvements. |
| **Final Verdict** | COMPLETED / PARTIALLY COMPLETED / FAILED |

The report is rendered as formatted Markdown in the terminal with Vault-Tec themed panels.

## Critic Sub-Agent

When the agent finishes with `goal_success=true`, the **Critic Sub-Agent** automatically evaluates the answer correctness against the original prompt and assigns a score from 0 to 10.

**Output includes:**
- Rating (0–10)
- Verdict (Correct / Partially / Incorrect)
- Short rationale

## Web Search Agent

The agent can search the internet during task execution using the built-in **WebSearchAgent**.

### Supported search engines:
| Engine | Setup | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **DuckDuckGo** | No API key required | Default engine |
| **SearxNG** | Requires self-hosted instance | More control, no rate limits |

### Features:
- **Multi-source aggregation**: Iterative internal loop gathers data from multiple sources
- **Content extraction**: Extracts and cleans main content from web pages (requires `beautifulsoup4`)
- **AI-powered evaluation**: Uses AI to assess search completeness and refine queries
- **Relevance scoring**: Keyword-based relevance scoring for each source (0.0–1.0)
- **Confidence scoring**: Overall confidence metric based on source count, relevance, and content depth

### Required dependencies for web search:
```bash
pip install ddgs beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

### Web search `.env` configuration:
```ini
# Search engine: duckduckgo or searxng
WEB_SEARCH_ENGINE=duckduckgo

# Enable page content extraction (default: true)
WEB_SEARCH_EXTRACT_CONTENT=true

# Max characters extracted per page (default: 10000)
WEB_SEARCH_MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH=10000
```

## Prompt Creator

The **Prompt Creator** is an interactive assistant that helps you build high-quality prompts for AI agents.

**How it works:**
- Guides you step-by-step, asking clarifying questions to gather all necessary details.
- Combines your answers into a single, coherent prompt draft.
- Supports multiline input (accept with Ctrl+S) and Fallout-style color themes.
- Lets you confirm or add more details at each step with Enter or Ctrl+S.
- Ensures your final prompt is precise, actionable, and ready for use with any supported AI engine.

## Usage

### Chat mode (questions, dialog):

```bash
python term_ask.py
```

### Agent mode (automation, tasks):

```bash
python term_ag.py
```

Force compact or normal pipeline:

```bash
python term_ag.py --compact
python term_ag.py --normal
python term_ag.py --hybrid
```

> **Operating Modes:** By default, the agent runs in **Collaborative Mode** and asks for confirmation before executing each command (`[y/N]`). To run in **Fully Automatic Mode**, either:
> - Set `AUTO_ACCEPT=true` in your `.env` file before starting
> - Press `Ctrl+A` during a session to switch from collaborative to automatic mode on-the-fly

### Remote agent mode (SSH):

```bash
python term_ag.py user@host
```

### Prompt Creator (interactive prompt builder):

```bash
python PromptCreator.py
```

### API mode (FastAPI):

The HTTP API exposes simple endpoints to run agent tasks synchronously or asynchronously.
Use `/run` for a single blocking request, `/run_async` for a background job, and `/runs` to submit batches.
If `API_SERVER_KEY` is set, include it in the `X-API-Key` header for all requests.

```bash
python term_api.py
```

Optional environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `API_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Address where the API server is listening |
| `API_PORT` | `8000` | API server port |
| `API_SERVER_KEY` | (empty) | Optional key required in X-API-Key header |
| `API_MAX_WORKERS` | `4` | Maximum number of tasks executed in parallel; excess goes to queue |
| `API_ENABLE` | `true` | API startup switch |

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your_key_if_set' \
  -d '{"goal":"list files in current directory"}'
```

If neither `pipeline_mode` nor `compact_mode` is provided, the API defaults to `pipeline_mode="hybrid"`.

Force normal mode and plan creation (API payload):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your_key_if_set' \
  -d '{"goal":"create an action plan for nginx setup","compact_mode":false,"force_plan":true}'
```

Hybrid mode (API payload):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your_key_if_set' \
  -d '{"goal":"list files in /tmp","pipeline_mode":"hybrid"}'
```

Async single request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run_async \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your_key_if_set' \
  -d '{"goal":"list files in current directory"}'
```

Batch async requests:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/runs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your_key_if_set' \
  -d '{"requests":[{"goal":"list files"},{"goal":"show uptime"}]}'
```

Check job status:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/runs/<job_id> \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your_key_if_set'
```

Note: `goal_success` is returned inside `result` only after the job completes.
If available, the API also returns `critic_rating`, `critic_verdict`, and `critic_rationale`.
These fields are `null` when `goal_success=false` or when the critic is disabled.

Cancel job:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/runs/<job_id> \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your_key_if_set'
```

Remote SSH example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run_async \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your_key_if_set' \
  -d '{"goal":"check disk space","host":"192.168.1.10","user":"root","port":22,"ssh_password":"your_password"}'
```

Custom system prompt example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run_async \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: your_key_if_set' \
  -d '{"goal":"list running services","system_prompt_agent":"You are a cautious Linux admin. Avoid destructive commands."}'
```

### Loading a prompt/goal from a file

You can load a prompt or goal from a file by typing:

```
/path/to/your_prompt.txt
```

The agent will read the file and use its contents as your goal or question.

### Continuing a session after task completion

After a task finishes, the agent asks if you want to continue:

```
VaultAI> Do you want continue this thread? [y/N]:
```

If you answer `y`, you can type a new goal. The full conversation history is preserved, giving the AI context from the previous task.

### Aliases

Add short aliases to your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
alias ask='cd /home/username/term_agent && source .venv/bin/activate && python term_ask.py'
alias ag='cd /home/username/term_agent && source .venv/bin/activate && python term_ag.py'
alias prom='cd /home/username/term_agent && source .venv/bin/activate && python PromptCreator.py'
```

Reload aliases:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

> **Tip:** For the best experience with remote agent mode (SSH), set up SSH key-based authentication on your target servers. This allows the agent to execute commands without repeatedly prompting for a password and improves both security and usability.
> **Tip:** Change the path `/home/username/term_agent` to your own if the project is in a different location.

> **Warning:**
> The agent can execute arbitrary shell commands (locally or remotely via SSH) based on user input or AI suggestions.
> **Always review and understand the commands before running the agent.**
> Using this tool may be unsafe on production systems or with sensitive data.
> You are responsible for any actions performed by the agent on your system.

> **Note:**
> The larger and more advanced the AI model you use (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini 1.5, or large Ollama models), the better and more reliable the agent's results will be. Smaller or older models may not handle complex tasks or multi-step automation as effectively.

## Example (chat)

When you start the chat, you might see:

```
VaultAI (cogito:8b) is online. Ask your questions?
```

**User:**
```
How do I install Docker on Ubuntu and run an nginx container?
```

**VaultAI:**
```
Here's how to install Docker on Ubuntu and run an Nginx container:

1. Update package list:
    sudo apt update

2. Install required packages:
    sudo apt install -y \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg-agent \
        software-properties-common

3. Add Docker's official GPG key:
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

4. Set up the stable repository:
    echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

5. Install Docker Engine:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

6. Start and enable Docker:
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker

7. Run an Nginx container:
    sudo docker run --name mynginx -d -p 8080:80 nginx

Now you can access Nginx at http://localhost:8080.
